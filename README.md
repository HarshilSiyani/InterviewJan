To run the backend
- cd backend
- npm start

Shoudl run at localhost:3001 and graphql GUI can be accessed at localhost:3001/graphql

To run the frontend
- cd frontend
- npm start

incase something isnt working well just try to ensure all the packages are installed.
to do this npm install

NOTE:

First run the backend server to not cause errors as graphql address wont be found if backend server is not running
Also, I have connected MongoDB. So one might need to set those values on the env file.
